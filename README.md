## 1. What?

**Loxel** building is a building entirely made out of lox; a voxel building built from mathematical objects that resemble logs. Loxs are 100% natural, highly arrangeable, entirely resusable, and can be readily made out of wood material that would otherwise be considered waste.

### 1.1. Etymology

**Loxel** is a novel term composed of two words "log" and "element". When combined, these two words perfectly describe the building block of loxel buildings. Simply put, loxel buildings are entirely built from loxels. 

One might then ask, how come there is an "x" in the name, instead of it simply being "Logel". Voxel is an established term that is defined as _any discrete element comprising a three-dimensional entity_, which is exactly what a loxel is.

### 1.2. Benefits

- The building is 100% natural
- The building can be easily altered
- The building can be made from waste, local timber, or ready-made massive wood elements
- The building is resusable
- The building materials are recyclable

## 2. Why?

The question then arise, why not just build from logs? This question is particularly resonant in areas where there are hundreds or thousands of years of ancestral tradition in building log houses from locally sourced timber. There are several aspects to the answer to this question: 

- Very few people have access to locally sourced timber
- Timber in log form is very expensive
- Processing timber into log form is very costly
- Timber quality (density and other factors) are drastically poorer than just 50 years ago
- Log houses are very hard to re-arrange
- Reusing log houses is costly and complicated
- Log houses can be built only from high quality timber

### 2.1. Parametric Design

**Loxel** is entirely parametric. In other words, instead of being drawn with pen and paper, or designed in a modelling software such as Archicad, loxel building is composed mathematically. For example, it is enough to input total floor area, number of rooms, rough indication of the percentile share of the floor area for each room, and the desired thermal properties of each room. The underlying parametric design workflow is then able to propose a buildable 3D-model which meets the desired criteria, and results in zero material waste. This is in stark contrast with a typical construction project, where design is costly, and up to 50% of materials end up being wasted.

### 2.2. Buildability First

Throughout the building worflow from idea to ready building, all stakeholders look at the same buildable model every step of the way. This approach dramatically reduces the possibility for error, and ensures that errors are identified as early in the process as possible. In typical construction project, a great number of errors are found only in the building phase, where they cost 13 times more to correct, than during the design phase.

## 3. What?

The composition of the loxel house can be through the aspects of material, the elements which are made out of that material, and the joints i.e. the means by which the elements are joint together.

### 3.1. Material

Regardless if waste, local timber, or ready-made massive wood elements are used, the element material is cross laminated timber. The timber is nailed with aluminum nails to form cross laminated elements, that provide structural properties far superior to traditional logs.  

### 3.2. Elements

Loxel building is made out of loxels. There is exactly three kinds of loxels. These are named "Single", "Half", and "Quarter" loxels. 

The **Single** is a full form loxel. For example, an element that is 4 meters long, 20 centimeters high, and 20 centimeters wide. Thus forming a 4000mm x 200mm x 200mm cross laminated timber element. 

The **Half** is exactly half of the length of the Single, and otherwise has the same dimensions. In other words, it has exactly half of the absolute volume of the Single. 

The **Quarter** is exactly quarter of the length of the Single, and otherwise has the same dimensions. In other words, it has exactly the quarter of the absolute volume of the Single.

**NOTE: The dimension and volume of the Single provided here are indicative. The dimension and volume of Half and Quarter will always follow the same pattern as in the above example.**

A research question is "what is the ideal size for a Single?" considering that: 

- The smaller it is, the more practical it is to move it around
- The larger it is, the less it needs to be joined with other elements

There is also the consideration in respect to permitted resolution for design; the smaller the object, the greater the resolution permitted. For example, in the indicative dimensionality provided above, the smaller resolution is 1 meter in length.

### 3.3. Joints

A major research question is "how are the elements to be joined?" in a way that supports: 

- Easy and rapid alteration of any part of the building
- Straigthforward preparation of the elements from waste, local timber, or ready-made massive wood elements
- Reusability of any part of the building in the same building or other loxel buildings
- Full recyclability

Moreover, the joining method must be 100% natural. 

### 3.4. Prototype Floor Plan

The proto loxel house will have a floor area of roughly 30m2 to fit within the area permitted by EU building regulation to be built without building permit.
