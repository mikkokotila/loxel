## 1. What?

**Loxel** building is a building entirely made out of lox; a voxel building built from mathematical objects that resemble logs. Loxs are 100% natural, highly arrangeable, entirely resusable, and can be readily made out of wood material that would otherwise be considered waste.

### 1.1. Etymology

**Loxel** is a novel term composed of two words "log" and "element". When combined, these two words perfectly describe the building block of loxel buildings. Simply put, loxel buildings are entirely built from loxels. 

One might then ask, how come there is an "x" in the name, instead of it simply being "Logel". Voxel is an established term that is defined as _any discrete element comprising a three-dimensional entity_

### 1.2. Benefits

- The building is 100% natural
- The building can be easily altered
- The building can be made from waste, local timber, or ready-made massive wood elements
- The building is resusable
- The building materials are recyclable
